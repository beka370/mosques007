            The history of this game Taraz was a criminal city.
            That's why it is being made as a GTA game.

            But it became really scary when the redistribution of spheres of influence began. Three large groups could not fit into one small city, and gang warfare ensued. Crime bosses began to kill each other with particular cruelty, without particularly caring about covering their tracks.

            A sequel that expanded the open world, GTA 2 added new features like
            gang affiliations, which affected how NPCs reacted to the player. It
            also introduced a futuristic setting, making it distinct from the
            modern-day locations of other entries.

            As a result, the long tentacles of various organized crime groups had a stranglehold on the entire city, including the police and local authorities. Even if some of the gang members were detained, they avoided severe punishment and soon returned to criminal activity.

            An ordinary merchant from the market could be so “swept away” that his own mother would not recognize him. And the especially stubborn ones even paid with their lives.

            In the dashing 90s, Taraz, of course, held the palm as the most criminal city in the country. There were seven organized criminal groups (OCGs) operating here at once, but three of them stood out for their particular cruelty, cynicism and lawlessness. Bandits of various stripes imposed tribute on all major entrepreneurs in the region, markets and shops. They allowed themselves to take goods directly from the shelves in broad daylight. Those who resisted were not treated on ceremony.

            Crime rampant in Taraz occurred in the early and mid-1990s. Let's look at the files of local newspapers of that time and see: criminal topics occupied a significant place. If we analyze the situation as a whole, we get a very, very entertaining picture, worthy of the attention of crime detective writers.

            The intention to return the ancient name Taraz to the city twenty-two years ago was received ambiguously by the public. And this is understandable - the townspeople loved the name of their city so much. Thus, there were various critical opinions on this matter.

            In general, 280 multi-apartment and 969 individual residential buildings will be built in the new microdistrict, where more than 30 thousand people are planned to live. The microdistrict is fully provided with the necessary infrastructure. 6.5 billion tenge was allocated from the budget for the construction of water supply, sewerage, gas, electrical and heat networks. To connect to the heating of houses in the area, a heating module worth 103.5 million tenge was installed.

            Can Taraz today be considered a gangster city?
             Some argue that the current situation in the city is no better 
             than it was until recently in the Kushchevskaya village of neighboring Russia, famous for banditry.

            Today Taraz is a large administrative center with a population of about 400 thousand inhabitants. The city is blooming before our eyes - in the last ten years, three new microdistricts have grown here, and another one is being built, the presentation of which took place quite recently. At the end of Ibragim Suleimenov Street, 11 high-rise buildings appeared, three of which are already occupied. Moreover, this happened thanks to the Nurly Zher state program.
